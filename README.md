# Sky-Shooter
A JavaFX game where an aircraft must avoid birds and asteroids.

WASD is used for movement and spacebar is used to shoot. Shooting objects give an additional score boost, although it is optional. The powerups include:

Heart - Recovers 20% of the player's health
Fuel - Increases the aircraft's speed
Star - Adds a randomly chosen amount to the player's score

The game is endless, and all scores are recorded into a text file.
